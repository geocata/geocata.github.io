Working on my own projects was the thing that initiated me in back end development (a social network for which I had to learn proper design patterns and adapting a framework, Codeigniter, to my needs). But the most things I learned was when I participated in the development of a complex platform as lead developer. I was given there the opportunity to learn many things. It was challenging because I had to take all the decisions regarding the development. I had to master proper design patterns, create a framework (DDD/CQRS type of framework because it felt like it was simpler to build one than to force things to work with an existing/open source framework), learn about domain driven design, command and query segregation, big data, microservices, high availability solutions for the tools I chose to work with, system distribution, types of testing. I had to learn about message queues and test Kafka and ActiveMQ (in the end the publishing and consumption was done at framework level), service discovery (Consul), AWS (VPC, EC2, networking and security, storage, IAM), Elastic Search for log centralization, big data , business intelligence and analytics tolls (just research to determine the requirements of the features) and many other things. I also gathered deeper knowledge about online marketing as the platform offered online marketing related services like website traffic, users, sales tracking and analytics, lead nurturing, lead recovery, return on ads investment analytics. Because all the things I  learned about programming, development, I learned them alone, it was not hard for me to adapt for this challenge.
