                    Why should the focus be on conventions and better practices (in this order)?

                <div class="articleParagraph">
                    There is no doubt that human imagination has no limits. We can imagine, we can abstract
                    at a high level pretty complex concepts and ideas, but, eventually, we are limited to 
                    what we can deploy, what we can write, all the details we can hold in our heads.
                </div>
                <div class="articleParagraph">
                    If we reach that limitation with a project, development will become slower, things 
                    will become hard to manage, to understand, things will get out of hand.
                    In order to overcome, to some degree, this impediment, we should have good code design,
                    a good architecture, we should make things seem  more natural.
                </div><br/>
                <p class="articleSubTitle">
                    How to make things seem more natural?
                </p>
                <p>
                    By following some current, accepted, good coding practices and conventions which are 
                    proven solutions to our human limitations.

                <p class="articleSubTitle">
                    What is a convention? (2 definitions from the dictionary)
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>"A way in which something is usually done."</li>
                    <li>"An agreement between states covering particular matters, especially one less formal than a treaty."</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    From this definition : "A way in which something is usually done." , we realize that 
                    conventions will help us work together as a group on some activities because they are 
                    an agreement, understood by many, on how things are usually done.
                    They should be accepted as a base for carrying out some work, but they should not be 
                    enforced (the word "usually" by definition implies something flexible). The conventions 
                    will help us to some degree, to feel more comfortable with our code base, find our
                    way fast when changes are required.

                    Preservation is in our nature as human beings. We are always seeking for new ways 
                    of making our lives simpler. We drive a car instead of walking, we prefer to 
                    manage machinery instead 
                    of managing and working with people. Because of this, we have always tried to
                    find new ways in which things "should" be done to have higher satisfaction and 
                    preservation levels.

                <div class="articleParagraph">
                    You noticed how things changed because of human nature? From "usually done" we went to 
                    "should be done". We found a link between conventions and development/evolution.
                    It is in our nature to feel comfortable about things and of course software is no 
                    exception.

                    Having established "A way in which something is usually done.", next we have to adapt. 
                    As developers, we constantly have to do that. Every day, we have new problems to solve.
                    New problems which may make us uncomfortable when following blindly the way in which
                    something is usually done.

                <div class="articleParagraph">
                    We have been doing this since forever. Look how human languages have evolved, how 
                    many new concepts we have created that we take them for granted now, like money or 
                    the economy. We simply shared with one another the knowledge, we agreed 
                    that it's improving right now our way of life and accepted it as a new convention. 
                    We all agreed for example, in the case of money, that bartering will not cut it anymore,
                    it's too hard to work with, to keep track of the value of every good in order arrange
                    a fair deal. We have agreed to use a single unit to describe value. We have paved the 
                    way for something simpler, more natural and scalable.

                <p class="articleSubTitle">
                    Who defines the proper conventions that we, as developers, should follow? 
                </p>
                <div class="articleParagraph">
                    We do, as a community, by sharing with others our ideas that we worked so hard on and
                    that we tried and tested and we realized that they improve development, not just by
                    the number of problems we can solve in a given amount of time but also the way we feel
                    about our code.
                </div>
                <div class="articleParagraph">
                    This does not imply that we should follow blindly every set of rules the majority 
                    decides. We should also strive to understand the current accepted ways of doing things 
                    and come up with new ideas if we see any flaws or find a way to make things seem simpler,
                    more natural. 
                </div>
                <div class="articleParagraph">
                    Even if our new ideas, solutions are not accepted by the majority, part of them can 
                    still be helpful, not just for others who can build an improved version of our solutions,
                    but for ourselves also, it is part of our evolution as software developers, engineers 
                    that give shape to our world.
                </div>
                <div class="articleParagraph">
                    We should not focus on aligning 100% to some practices imposed by a majority, or some
                    organization that tries to enforce them. We should strive to come up with better
                    practices and not force every solution to be implemented in the same way. We should
                    strive to evolve and find better ways of solving problems. We should run away from 
                    organizations, groups that are not flexible, where teams stay aligned 100% with the 
                    organization. These kind of groups, organizations lack the feel of evolution, and when
                    they do decide to follow new, better practices, the costs might be too high to apply 
                    the changes (in the video linked below, at the end after minute 60, you can see an 
                    example where a company, Knight Capital Group, lost more than 450 million when they 
                    decided to update legacy code, 8 years old code. Shortly after this error, they 
                    agreed to be acquired by another company).

                <div class="articleParagraph">
                    We should work with and follow people who want to apply better practices even if 
                    they miss some of the requirements of a problem. They are the kind of people 
                    who feel natural with their work, confident and can fit more details in their heads
                    about a problem or a solution.<br/><br/>

                <div class="articleParagraph">
                    If a company is focused on following some practices strictly with less room for
                    flexibility, would you want to follow such an organization? Will that company be able 
                    to keep up with progress when its priority is to enforce some standards for better 
                    delivery frequency? Will that company last long on a market that is constantly changing?
                    I would answer no to all these questions. I know that companies still try to keep up 
                    with progress, but sadly, many times is not because of their internal culture, 
                    but because of our desire to evolve.

                <div class="articleParagraph">
                    "Our standardized monthly scrum performance report shows your delivery rate is below
                    average". 
                </div>
                <div class="articleParagraph">
                    These types of reports generally deny the existence of technical debt, 
                    rule out flexibility, they enforce the organization standards. 
                </div>
                <div class="articleParagraph">
                    I do agree that there must be deadlines, reasonable ones, but these kind of
                    performance reports that focus on delivery often do not take into consideration if 
                    the code is maintainable, robust and if the ability to change comes natural. Many 
                    problems we are trying to solve are different and often when diving in the details, 
                    more problems emerge, problems which you may not notice if you are forced by some 
                    organization's standards.

                    I think we should follow proper conventions, but we should also leave

                    a more robust codebase.
